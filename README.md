# Jynnie Link Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension for https://link.jynnie.me/ based on the HackMIT Go Link Chrome Extension (modified under MIT License)

Just type `link something` in the omnibar...

The extension also finds all instances of "link/whatever", even on Google Docs
and stuff, and automatically turns them into clickable links!
